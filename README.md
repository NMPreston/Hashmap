# Hashmaps

This project showcases a custom implementation of a Hash Map in Python. The hashmap.py script provides a simplified version of the hash table data structure, demonstrating how key-value pairs can be stored, retrieved, and managed efficiently.

Project Structure

hashmap.py: The main Python script containing the implementation of the Hash Map, including methods for insertion, deletion, lookup, and handling hash collisions.
Features

Insertion (put): Adds a new key-value pair to the hash map.
Retrieval (get): Retrieves the value associated with a given key.
Deletion (remove): Removes a key-value pair from the hash map.
Collision Handling: Implements a method for managing hash collisions (e.g., separate chaining or open addressing).
Capacity Management: Includes logic for resizing the hash map when the load factor exceeds a certain threshold.
